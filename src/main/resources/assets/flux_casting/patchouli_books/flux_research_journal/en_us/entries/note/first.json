      "text": "whoever you may be. This is of utmost importance. You are our only hope. I need you to seek out a flux leak. I am unable to describe what these leaks look like anymore, as I am now 300 years in the past. However, given that the universe still exists, I presume that the rifts have not yet torn it apart, indicating that a major rift has not recently opened."

      "text": "Your best chance of finding a flux leak is to inspect stone; these leaks tend to manifest in stone and do not disperse, causing the flux to solidify. Once you locate such a leak, please break the leak and observe the outcome. It is imperative that you continue this research. You must safeguard this universe. Sincerely, Dr. Aiden"
